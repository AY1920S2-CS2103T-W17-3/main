== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/team/easytravel/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/team/easytravel/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deleteitem 1`.

.Component interactions for `deleteitem 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/team/easytravel/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `SideTabsBar`, `XYZTabPanel`, `DashboardPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/team/easytravel/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[#logic-component]
[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/team/easytravel/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `EasyTravelParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deleteitem 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deleteitem 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteItemCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/team/easytravel/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<XYZ>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
====
XYZManager refers to:

* `TripManager`
* `ActivityManager`
* `TransportationBookingManager`
* `AccommodationBookingManager`
* `PackingListManager`
* `FixedExpenseManager`

The ObservableList<XYZ> includes all managers except for the Trip Manager
====

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/team/easytravel/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the XYZManager data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `team.easytravel.commons` package.

[#implementation]

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.
// tag::TripManagement[]

=== Trip Manager
*E.T*  allows the user to plan for an overseas trip. *E.T* is implemented in a way that the user can only plan for one single trip at any time. i.e. Only a single trip’s data can be managed. In this Trip Manager feature, the user can set, edit and delete his/her trip details. The trip details includes:


* `title`
* `budget`
* `exchangeRate`
* `startDate`
* `endDate`


==== Rationale
The Trip Manager feature is included in **E.T.** because it is the core feature of the application. If the user wants to plan for an overseas trip, he/she has to record details about the trip.

==== Current Implementation
The `TripManager` class in the `Model` component is responsible for all operations on the trip which is represented by the `Trip` class. The following _Class Diagram_ describes the structure of the `TripManager` and its relevant classes.


.Structure of the `TripManager` and its relevant classes.
image::developer-guide/trip/TripClassDiagram.png[]

As seen from the diagram, the `TripManager` can only manage one trip at any point in time.
Next, the following table shows the commands related to managing the trip details.


|===
|Command |Purpose

|`settrip`
|Adds a trip and sets the trip details.

|`rename`
|Edits the trip title.

|`editbudget`
|Edits the budget of the trip.

|`deletetrip`
|Deletes the trip and all the data in the App.
|===

This ability to change the start and end dates and the exchange rate of the trip is not available.

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Number of trips allowed to be managed


|===
| |Pros |Cons

|**Option 1 (Current)**
Only one
|Easy to implement. `TripManager` just needs to hold one `Trip` object.
|Less flexibility for the user.

|**Option 2**
More than one
|More flexibility for the user.
|More overhead, especially in terms of space.
|===

Reasons for choosing the option 1:

* A typical user would only plan one trip at a time. Thus, the overhead incurred by option 2 is not justified.
* Limited time for implementing this feature. Thus, option 1 is more ideal.


===== Aspect: Ability to edit the details of the trip

|===
| |Pros |Cons

|**Option 1 (Current)**
Can only edit the title and budget.
|Easy to implement. Nothing depends on the trip title and budget.
|Users who need to change the dates or exchange rate of the trip need to delete and then set the trip which is troublesome.

|**Option 2**
Can edit every detail.
|More flexibility and convenience for the user.
|The schedule feature depends on the trip dates while the expense feature depends on the exchange rate. Thus, allowing these fields to be changed is very difficult to implement and likely to result in bugs.
|===

Reasons for choosing option 1:

* The exchange rate of a trip does not tend to fluctuate much, thus the cons of option 2 outweigh the pros for the exchange rate.
* As for the trip dates, the schedule feature is a big feature of **E.T.** and it depends on the trip dates. Given the limited time for implementation, we decided to opt for a less bug-prone approach that can showcase **E.T.**’s feature.

// end::Trip Management[]

// List management
// tag::scheduleactivity[]
[#list-manager]
=== List Managers
**E.T.** allows the user to schedule an activity from the activity list to a specified time of a day. This is done using the `schedule` command which requires the user to specify the `INDEX` of an activity from the displayed activity list, the `DAY_INDEX` of the trip and the `START_TIME` of the activity to be scheduled.

==== Rationale
The schedule feature is an important feature that allows the users to manage and plan for their trip schedule or itinerary. This feature is added to **E.T.** to separate from the activity management feature from the schedule. This can increase the ease of planning because users can just focus on the time management aspect when scheduling proposed activities from the activity list. The schedule feature also automatically adds any transport bookings into the schedule.

==== Current Implementation
The schedule feature uses a separate system and structure as compared to the `ListManager`s. Instead, the schedule feature will be more closely related to the trip feature because it heavily relies on information about the `Trip` such as the `startDate` and `endDate`.

As such, the `TripManager` is in charge of managing the schedule. The `TripManager`, contains a list of `DaySchedule`s which represents the schedule of a specific day of the `Trip`. Thus, the number of `DaySchedule`s equals the number of days in the `Trip`. E.g. a trip of 2 days means that the `TripManager` contains 2 `DaySchedule` objects.

Within each `DaySchedule` object, there is a `UniqueList` of `DayScheduleEntry`. The `DayScheduleEntry` object represents an entry in the schedule.
As an example, the following UML object diagram describes the relevant objects related to this feature when a `Trip` of 2 days is set.


.Example of associations between related objects of the schedule feature.
image::developer-guide/schedule/ScheduleFeatureObjectDiagram.png[]

When the user enters the `schedule` command to schedule an activity, the user input command undergoes the same command parsing as described in <<DeveloperGuide.adoc#logic-component, Section 2.3 Logic Component>> . A `ScheduleCommand` will then be created.
The following steps describe the execution of the `ScheduleCommand`, assuming that no error is encountered.

. When `execute()` of the `ScheduleCommand` is called, the `ModelManager` retrieves the displayed list of activities shown to the user.
. Then, it retrieves the target `Activity` using the user-specified `INDEX`.
. The `ModelManager`’s `scheduleActivity()` method is called to schedule the target `Activity`.
. The `ModelManager` proceeds to call the `scheduleActivity()` method of the `TripManager`.
. The `TripManager` then uses the given activity to create a corresponding `DayScheduleEntry` object.
. The `TripManager will calculate which day of the trip to schedule this activity and get the `DaySchedule` representing the schedule of the target day.
. The target activity is then scheduled on the target day through the `addScheduleEntry()` method of the target `DaySchedule`.
. If the above steps are all successful, the `ScheduleCommand` will then create a `CommandResult` object and return the result.

The  _Sequence Diagram_ below summarizes the execution of the `ScheduleCommand`.

.Execution of the `ScheduleCommand`.
image::developer-guide/schedule/ScheduleCommandExecution.png[Schedule Activity Command Execution]

[NOTE]
====
The lifelines for the `ScheduleCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X). However, due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of the diagram.

This sequence diagram does not take into consideration the possible exceptions which might occur during the `ScheduleCommand` execution.

====

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Separation between scheduling and activity management


|===
| |Pros |Cons

|**Option 1 (Current)**
Scheduling is separated from activity management.

|Better user experience.
Allows for extensions. Other types of objects such as a `TransportBooking` could easily be converted into a `DayScheduleEntry` object and be added into the schedule. This is by the Open-Closed principle.
|Complicated to implement and more likely to result in bugs if undesirable dependencies are introduced.

|**Option 2**
An activity must be scheduled directly into a day as it is added.
i.e. `ActivityManager` is in charge of scheduling.

|Straightforward and simple to implement.

|Other types of objects such as `TransportBooking` will not be able to be scheduled. This can result in poorer user experience when using **E.T.** as users may want to include transport bookings into their schedule.
|===

Reasons for choosing option 1:

* The schedule feature is a major feature because it is the main part of planning for a trip. Thus, we decided to opt for the option with better user experience.
* The ability for other objects to be converted into a `DayScheduleEntry` object in option 1 is also beneficial for future versions of **E.T.** if we want to extend this feature to schedule other items such as accommodation bookings.

// End list management
//end



=== Activity Manager
**E.T.** allows the user to keep track of their activities for his/her trip. The activity manager is one of the `ListManager`s <<DeveloperGuide.adoc#list-manager, (See Section 3.1 List Managers)>>. On top of the basic operations provided by a `ListManager`, it also allows the user to search for their activities using the `findacitivty` command. The parameters of the `findactivity` command are keywords in the activity entries that the user wants to search for. E.g. `findactivity sightseeing carnival` will search and list all activity entries with `sightseeing` or `carnival` in their detail. Another similar command, `findactivitytag` has the same functionality but only searches for the tags of activity entries.


`ActivityManager` has other than the basic CRUD commands, find command provide a find command to assist in activity management such as:
* `findactivitytag`
* `findactivity`

==== Rationale
The activity manager is an important feature to have because any oversea trip will be packed with activities for the traveller. Thus, we decided to create an activity manager as one of the `ListManager`s.

==== Current Implementation

The current implementation of the activity manager only allows the user to keep track of a list of activities for their trip. It does not allow the user to indicate the start and end time of an activity. Instead, the ability to indicate a start time for an activity will be in another feature known as the schedule feature (See Section 3.4).

In this section, we will outline the `findactivity` command of the activity manager which is summarised by the __Activity Diagram__ below.


.Activity diagram showing the workflow of a `findactivity` command.
image::developer-guide/activity/FindActivityDiagram.png[]

The sequence diagram below shows the creation of the an ActivityCommand object:

.Sequence diagram that describes the creation of the `deleteactivity` from the input user command `deleteactivity 1`.

image::developer-guide/activity/DeleteActivityCommandCreation.png[]

When the user enters the `findactivity` command to search for activities, the user input command undergoes the same command parsing as described in Section 2.3 Logic Component. During the parsing, a predicate is created. This predicate checks if a given `Activity` contains the user input keywords. The `FindActivityCommand` will then receive this predicate when it is created.

The following steps will describe the execution of the `FindActivityCommand` in detail, assuming that no error is encountered.

. When the `execute()` method of the `FindActivityCommand` is called, the `ModelManager`’s `updateFilteredActivityList()` method is called.
. The `ModelManager` then proceeds to call the `updateFilteredActivityList()` method of the `ActivityManager`.
. The `ActivityManager` will then update its filtered list of `Activity`s to contain only `Activity`s that fulfil the given predicate.
. The `Ui` component will detect this change and update the __GUI__.
. If the above steps are all successful, the `ScheduleCommand` will then create a `CommandResult` object and return the result.

The __Sequence Diagram__ below summarises the aforementioned steps.

.Execution of the `FindActivityCommand`.

image::developer-guide/activity/FindActivitySequenceDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
====
The lifelines for the `FindActivityCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X). However, due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of the diagram.

This sequence diagram does not take into consideration the possible exceptions which might occur during the `FindActivityCommand` execution.

====

==== Design Consideration
We do not have other implementation options for the `FindActivityCommand` as the current implementation is the only option that we came up with. This option is quite easy to understand and follows good coding principles.

// tag::scheduleactivity[]
[#schedule-feature]
=== Schedule feature
**E.T.** allows the user to schedule an activity from the activity list to a specified time of a day. This is done using the `schedule` command which requires the user to specify the `INDEX` of an activity from the displayed activity list, the `DAY_INDEX` of the trip and the `START_TIME` of the activity to be scheduled.

* The ability for other objects to be converted into a `DayScheduleEntry` object in option 1 is also beneficial for future versions of **E.T.** if we want to extend this feature to schedule other items such as accommodation bookings.

// End scheduler


// tag::transportbooking[]
=== Transport Booking feature

E.T. allows the user to add a transport booking. This is done using the schedule command which requires the user to specify the mode, start location, end location, start time and end time.

==== Rationale

The transport booking feature is an important feature that allows the user to track the list of transport bookings that they have made before leaving.
This feature also allows the user to schedule their activities while taking the scheduled transport bookings into consideration.

==== Current Implementation

The keywords from the command given by the user is parsed using `AddTransportBookingCommandParser` which converts the string variable `mode` into a `Mode` object, `start location` and `end location` into a `Location` objects, as well as `start time` and `end time` into `Time` objects.
These objects are used to create the `AddTransportBookingCommand` object that will execute to create a transport booking.

The activity diagram below shows the creation of the `AddTransportBookingCommand` object:

.Activity diagram showing the workflow of a `AddTransportBooking` command.
image::developer-guide/transport-booking/AddTransportBookingActivityDiagram.png[]

After the creation of the `AddTransportBookingCommand` object, the `LogicManager` will proceed to call the `execute()` method of `AddTransportBookingCommand`.

The following steps describes the execution of the `AddTransportBookingCommand`:

1.	In `Model`, the `AddTransportBookingCommand` checks the current transport booking list for duplicates before adding the new object into the transport booking list
2. A `CommandResult` object which consists of a `MESSAGE_SUCCESS` is sent back to `LogicManager` if there is a successful addition of the transport booking into the transport booking list
3.	After receiving the `CommandResult` from `AddTransportBookingCommand`, `LogicManager` will return the `CommandResult` back to “MainApp” where the updated transport booking list is shown.

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect:

* **Current Choice:**
** **Pros:**
** **Cons:**

* **Alternative:**
** **Pros:**
** **Cons:**
// end::transportbooking[]

// tag::accommodationbooking[]
=== Accommodation Booking feature

E.T. allows the user to add an accommodation booking. This is done using the schedule command which requires the user to specify the accommodation name, location, start day, end day and a remark. This feature also prevents the user from having an overlap of accommodation.

The activity contains the following fields:

* `accommodation name`
* `location`
* `start day`
* `end day`
* `remarks`

==== Rationale

The accommodation booking feature is an important feature that allows the user to track the list of accommodation bookings that they have made before leaving.

==== Current Implementation

When a user adds an accommodation booking using the `AddAccommodationBookingCommandParser`, an `AddAccommodationBookingCommand` object is created that will execute to create an accommodation booking. When the `execute()` method is called, a method `isOverlappingWithOthers()` will check if there is an overlap of the new accommodation booking with the other bookings.

Using a stream, the new accommodation booking will be against all other bookings in the list to find look for any overlaps. The activity diagram shows how 2 bookings are checked if there is an overlap:

.Activity diagram of check overlap for 2 accommodation bookings
image::developer-guide/accommodation-booking/FindOverlapActivityDiagram.png[]

The following steps describes the process of the check overlap method:

. The start day and end day of both bookings are retrieved using `getStartDay()` and `getEndDay()`
. The largest end day and smallest start day is calculated and the difference of the largest and smallest is calculated
. The duration of both bookings is calculated by adding the difference of the end day and start day of both bookings
. If the difference of the largest end day and smallest start day is greater than the duration of both bookings, there is no overlap. The accommodation booking will then be added into the list.
. If there is an overlap, user will receive a message that informs that there is the new accommodation booking has an overlap with another booking.

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Calculating overlap of the new accommodation booking with the other accommodation bookings in the list

|===
| |Pros |Cons
|Current Choice : Using stream to compare the accommodation bookings
|Few lines of codes needed to compare the bookings, follows the KISS principle
|Difficult for beginner users to understand our code

|Alternative Choice: Using an arraylist of days to track accommodations
|Easy to use and understand
|Requires many lines of code, may become difficult to read
|===
// end::accommodationbooking[]

// tag::activity[]



// tag::packinglist[]
=== Packing List feature

*_E.T._* allows the user to create a packing list. The packing list manager handles everything to do with manipulating of packing list items.

The packing list item contains the following fields:

* `itemName`
* `quantity`
* `itemCategory`

`PackingListManager` has commands other than the basic CRUD commands, such as:

* `finditem`
** Finds packing list items based on the keywords given by the user
* `finditemcategory`
** Finds packing list items in the categories given by the user
* `addpreset`
** Adds a pre-existing list of items in a category into the current packing list
* `listpreset`
** Shows the available presets that the user can add into the packing list

I will be focusing on the `addpreset` command here. The `addpreset` command requires the user to include the `category` of the preset they want to add into the packing list.
For example, `addpreset swimming` means that the preset called `swimming` will be added into the user's packing list.
Only pre-existing presets can be added into the user's packing list.

==== Rationale
The packing list feature is an important feature that allows the users to plan and pack for their trip. It ensures that the user did not forget to pack anything for their trip, providing convenience.

==== Current Implementation

The keywords from the command given by the user is parsed using `AddPresetCommandParser` which converts the string variable `category` into a `ItemCategory` object.
These objects are used to create the `AddPresetCommand` object that will execute to create a list of packing list items.

The sequence diagram below shows the creation of the `AddPresetCommand` object:

.Activity diagram showing the workflow of an `addpreset` command.
image::developer-guide/packing-list/AddPackingListActivityDiagram.png[]

After the creation of the `AddPresetCommand` object, the `LogicManager` will proceed to call the `execute()` method of `AddPresetCommand`.

The following steps describes the execution of the `AddPresetCommand`:

1.	In `Model`, the `AddPresetCommand` adds a list of pre-existing list of items under a category into the packing list. If it encounters duplicates, it will skip the duplicate, and continue adding the rest of the items in the preset into the packing list.
2. A `CommandResult` object which consists of a `MESSAGE_SUCCESS` is sent back to `LogicManager` if there is a successful addition of the preset items into the packing list.
3.	After receiving the `CommandResult` from `AddPresetCommand`, `LogicManager` will return the `CommandResult` back to “MainApp” where the updated packing list is shown.

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect:

* **Current Choice:** Users choose a preset list of items under a category
** **Pros:** Gives the user more convenience; allows them to add a list of items at one go, instead of adding an item each time.
** **Cons:** Users are only able to choose from the pre-existing list of presets, hence not a lot of freedom to create their own preset.

* **Alternative:** Users create their own presets
** **Pros:** Gives the user a lot of freedom to customise their presets and packing list, making it user focused.
** **Cons:** Difficult to implement
// end::packinglist[]

// tag::fixedexpense[]
=== Fixed expense feature

*_E.T._* allows the user to create a fixed expense. The fixed expense manager handles everything to do with manipulating of fixed expenses.

This `sortexpense` command requires the user to include the `order` of the sorting, which is either ascending or descending, and the `criteria` of the sorting, which is either amount, blah or category.
For example, `sortexpense asc amount` sorts the fixed expense list in ascending order, according to the amount of the fixed expenses.

==== Rationale
The fixed expense feature is an important feature that allows the users to plan financially for their trip. It allows the user keeps track of the amount spent on the big ticket items, such as plane tickets and accommodation bookings.

==== Current Implementation

The keywords from the command given by the user is parsed using `SortFixedExpenseCommandParser` which converts the retrieves the order of the sort, and the sorting criteria.
These objects are used to create the `SortFixedExpenseCommand` object that will execute the sorting of the fixed expense list according to the given order and criteria.

The sequence diagram below shows the creation of the `SortFixedExpenseCommand` object:

[KIV]
Figure x.x: Sequence diagram of a Sort Fixed Expense command.

After the creation of the `SortFixedExpenseCommand` object, the `LogicManager` will proceed to call the `execute()` method of `SortFixedExpenseCommand`.

The following steps describes the execution of the `SortFixedExpenseCommand`:

1.	In `Model`, the `SortFixedExpenseCommand` sorts the current fixed expense list according to an order and criteria.
2. A `CommandResult` object which consists of a `MESSAGE_SUCCESS` is sent back to `LogicManager` if there is a successful sorting of the fixed expense list.
3.	After receiving the `CommandResult` from `SortFixedExpenseCommand`, `LogicManager` will return the `CommandResult` back to “MainApp” where the sorted fixed expense list is shown.

==== Design Consideration

* **Current Choice:** Sorting criteria can only be `amount`, `description` or `category`
** **Pros:** Keeps the implementation simple, as well as the fields of fixed expense only contain the above criteria
** **Cons:** Restricts the user on the criteria they can use, prevents them from customising the sorting of their fixed expense list.

* **Alternative:** Sorting criteria can be anything the user inputs
** **Pros:** Not restricted to a fixed criteria, gives the user freedom to choose and customise their sorting criteria.
** **Cons:** Difficult to implement, too many criteria to consider.

[#progress-checker]
=== Progress Checker
This feature allows the user to keep track of the progress of his/her planning. It integrates multiple features to show the user what has been done and what needs to be done for his/her trip. The command to check the current progress is `status`. The following aspect of the trip will be shown to the user:

* `Accommodation` - Accommodation coverage
* `Schedule` - Time clash in the schedule
* `PackingList` - Number of items packed or yet to be packed
* `Expense` - Remaining budget


==== Rationale

This feature is added because as a travel planning application, the user would want to know his progress when planning for a trip. Thus, information on what is done and what needs to be done will help the user gauge his planning progress. The user would also want to know if they have forgotten to plan for any aspect of a trip which will be provided by this feature.

==== Current Implementation
The following __Activity Diagram__ summarizes what happens when a user enters the `status` command.


.Workflow of the `status` command.
image::developer-guide/progress-checker/CheckStatusActivityDiagram.png[]

When a user enters the `status` command, the `Logic` Component parses and creates a `CheckStatusCommand` object. <<DeveloperGuide.adoc#logic-component, (See Section 2.3 Logic Component)>>.

The execution of the `CheckStatusCommand` undergoes the following steps.

. The `ModelManager`’s `getStatus()` will first be called.
. The `ModelManager` calls the `getScheduleStatus()` method of the `TripManager`.
. The `ModelManager` calls the `getStatus()` method of the `PackingListManager`.
. The `ModelManager` calls the `getStatus()` method of the `FixedExpenseManager`.
. The `ModelManager` calls the `getStatus()` method of the `AccommodationBookingManager`.
. After all the required data is obtained, the `ModelManager` will return the data to the `CheckStatusCommand`.
. The `CheckStatusCommand` will then create a new `CommandResult` object using the data obtained and return this `CommandResult` object.

[NOTE]
====
The lifelines for the `CheckStatusCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X). However, due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of the diagram.

This sequence diagram does not take into consideration the possible exceptions which might occur during the `CheckStatusCommand` execution.

==== Design Considerations

We do not have other implementation options for this feature as the current implementation is the only option that we came up with. It is also a good option because it follows good coding principles such as the Law of Demeter (LoD). In our implementation, each object only calls the methods of other objects that it is directly associated with.

E.g. the `CheckStatusCommand` object only calls the the `ModelManager` object’s `getStatus()` method and the `ModelManager` object only calls the the `PackingListManager` object’s `getStatus()`. The `CheckStatusCommand` object does not know or have access to the `getStatus()` method of the `PackingListManager` object.


// End checkstatus

[#logging]
=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[#implementation-configuration]
[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
