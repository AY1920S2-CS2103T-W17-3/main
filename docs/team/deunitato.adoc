== PROJECT: E.T. Easy Travel

== Overview
My team of 4 software engineering students and I were tasked with enhancing a basic command-line interface desktop address book application for our Software Engineering project. We chose to morph it into a travel planning application, called E.T, short for Easy Travel. E.T. will help reduce the amount of stress and anxiety when planning for a trip. E.T. is a desktop application that helps travellers manage and plan for their trips.

=== About E.T.
E.T. is a desktop travel planning application to provide a simple an easy way for users to prepare for their trip. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

The activity manager feature allows the user to keep track of all the activities planned for their trip.

** Justification: This feature is essential when planning for a trip, as it allows the user to remember all of the activities planned so far.

** Highlights: This feature has a find activity by both the title, and the

** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
