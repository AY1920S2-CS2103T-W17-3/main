== *Introduction*

Welcome to the user guide for E.T.

Easy Travel (E.T.) is tailored towards travellers who prefer to use a desktop app to manage their trip planning through the use of inbuilt sample packing list, an expense tracker to note down expenses and a diary to log down places went and the amount spent in each location. Easy Tracker also provides a checklist to ensure users do not forget anything necessary for their trip.

E.T. 2.0 is well suited for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you are comfortable with typing and can do it quickly, you can manage your trips quicker than comparable GUI applications. If you are interested, continue reading on to get started. Enjoy!

== *Quick Start*

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `E.T.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[This link have to change].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Easy Travel.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
